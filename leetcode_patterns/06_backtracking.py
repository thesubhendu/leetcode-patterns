Backtracking Pattern

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to problems 
by incrementally building candidates and abandoning a candidate as soon as it's determined 
that it cannot lead to a valid solution (pruning).

Key characteristics:
1. Decision making: At each step, make a choice from available options
2. Constraints: Check if current state violates any constraints
3. Goal check: Determine if current state is a solution
4. Pruning: Abandon paths that cannot lead to valid solutions

Common patterns in backtracking:
- Permutations and combinations
- Subset problems
- String partitioning
- Grid/maze traversal
- N-Queens problem
